# A simple smwcentral.net romhack downloader and patcher.

Currently only supports Super Mario World romhacks. Very WIP
## YOU MUST PROVIDE YOUR OWN ROM!
By default, you will have to name it `smw.sfc` and put it in the same directory as downloader.py, but currently this can be changed in downloader.py by changing the `base_rom` line.
